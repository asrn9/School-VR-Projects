Sci-Fi VR 
-


Sci-Fi VR is a compilation of 3 different assignments that I ended up making into one, as it seemed similar enough to simply just make them into one project.

What I made in Sci-Fi VR:

    1. NavMesh for AI Characters to Walk/Run
      - Made System to make AI Characters randomly start walking/running to a location
    2. HUD for Player to display:
      - Crosshair
      - Ironman-esque displays
      - Quests
    3. Headmounted Laser (Line Renderer & Raycast)
    4. In World Space Score System and Display for Destroying Enemies
    5. Doors that open when interacting with the Door Console
    6. Navigation System to Move Player in VR via Teleporting
    7. Water Sprinkler System controlled by ingame console
